[technology-description]
Q-AICore:ai-core=A state of the art artificial intelligence.  Increases the productivity of research labs.
Q-AICore:p-equals-np=Solution to the P versus NP problem.  Improves AI cores.

[technology-effects]
ai-core-algorithm-effectivity=AI core algorithm level: +1

[command-help]
ai-core-debug=Toggles the debug version of the AI core GUI.  It's not designed for normal players to use.

[ai-core-gui]
subheader=Cumulative effect of all AI cores
research-title=Research properties
research-disabled=Research is disabled.
difficulty-title=Technology difficulty:
difficulty-tooltip=A setting chosen during map creation.\nAffects how powerful AI cores are.
algorithm-title=Algorithm level:
algorithm-tooltip=Affects how powerful AI cores are.
bonus-tech-title=From technologies:
bonus-tech-tooltip=Productivity bonus from researched technologies only.
bonus-ai-cores-title=From AI cores:
bonus-ai-cores-tooltip=Productivity bonus from AI cores only.
bonus-ai-cores-tooltip-alone=Productivity bonus from AI cores.
bonus-final-title=Combined:
bonus-final-tooltip=This effect stacks additively with any productivity modules placed in labs.
debug-gui-title=AI cores (debug info)
debug-subheader=Global parameters
debug-difficulty-title=Technology difficulty:
debug-difficulty-title-tooltip=This is a setting chosen at the start of the game.\nIf this setting is changed mid-game, the AI core logic will update accordingly.\nBut please don't do that, as the Factorio game engine in general doesn't like changing difficulty mid-game.
debug-difficulty-value=__1__ (^__2__)
debug-difficulty-value-tooltip=The exponent you see here is one of the numbers in the formula that converts the AI core "base val" into the productivity modifier for that force.\nThe exponent is based on the chosen technology difficulty.
debug-watchlist-title=Technology watchlist:
debug-watchlist-title-tooltip=A list of technologies that grant research productivity bonuses.\nThese technologies stack multiplicatively with AI cores, but for that to work, the AI core logic needs to keep a list of all technologies that grant this type of bonus, because this mod's logic needs to override the core game engine logic.
debug-watchlist-value=List with __1__ elements. (Hover to see the list.)
debug-watchlist-empty=Empty list.
debug-watchlist-empty-tooltip=There are no technologies which grant research productivity bonuses.
debug-more=Hover for more info on the technology watchlist.
debug-more-tooltip=If the watchlist would change (by adding or removing mods with technologies that grant research productivity bonuses), this mod will update the watchlist internally when a new game session is loaded.  However, the per-force values won't update until a technology for that force is either researched or unresearched.  This GUI won't update the values until you close it & reopen it.
debug-strength-title=Strength multiplier:
debug-strength-title-tooltip=This is a per-map setting that scales the size of the productivity bonus from AI cores.
debug-strength-value-tooltip=This number affects very force's AI cores.\nDefault value: 10\nMinimum value: 1\nMaximum value: 100
debug-epsilon-title=EPSILON:
debug-epsilon-title-tooltip=This is an internal constant used in calculating the amount of "base val" any given force has.  It's only used if a force stops producing "base val."
debug-epsilon-value-tooltip=If a force's amount of "base val" ever drops below this number, it is set to 0 instead.\nA force cannot have a negative amount of "base val."
debug-tracked-title=Number of tracked AI cores:
debug-tracked-title-tooltip=Instead of calling surface.find_entities_filtered, this mod keeps a running list of all AI cores in the world.
debug-tracked-value-tooltip=This is the number of elements in that list.
debug-force=Force: __1__
debug-force-current=Force: __1__ (your force)
debug-research-title=Research:
debug-research-title-tooltip=The game engine allows research to be enabled or disabled on a per-force basis.  This is useful, for example, for scenarios that involve a method of progression other than the technology tree.\nBy default, research is enabled for all forces.
debug-research-enabled=Enabled.
debug-research-enabled-tooltip=This force is set to have research enabled.\nThis is the default setting for all forces.\nThis force's AI cores will function normally.
debug-research-disabled=Disabled.
debug-research-disabled-tooltip=This force is set to have research disabled.\nThis force's AI cores will do nothing.
debug-algorithm-title=Algorithm level:
debug-algorithm-title-tooltip=A feature of this mod that multiplies how much "base val" each of this force's AI cores provides.\nAlgorithm level begins at 1, but can be increased with certain researches.
debug-algorithm-value-tooltip=*__1__ multiplier to production of "base val."\nApplies to this force's AI cores only.
debug-base-val-title="Base val":
debug-base-val-title-tooltip=The internal number from which research productivity modifiers are calculated.  You can think of it as a hidden resource.
debug-base-val-value-tooltip=This number increases linearly with time proportional to the number of this force's active AI cores, but "base val" also decays exponentially.  Over time, an equilibrium value is reached, which is approximately 100 units of "base val" per active AI core.
debug-equivalent-multiplier-tooltip=Equivalent to a *__1__ multiplier.
debug-ai-core-title=Productivity modifier from AI cores:
debug-ai-core-title-tooltip=Research productivity modifier from AI cores alone.
debug-tech-title=Productivity modifier from researched technologies:
debug-tech-title-tooltip=Research productivity modifier from researched technologies alone.
debug-final-title=Final productivity modifier:
debug-final-title-tooltip=The value actually applied to lab research.\nCalculated by multiplying the multipliers for the two values above.\nThis is the value displayed in the force's Bonuses page.\nProductivity modules in labs stack additively with this.

[mod-setting-name]
Q-AICore:decimal-places-to-show=GUI numerical precision
Q-AICore:ai-core-bonus-multiplier=Strength multiplier

[mod-setting-description]
Q-AICore:decimal-places-to-show=This is the number of decimal places to show in the AI core GUI.
Q-AICore:ai-core-bonus-multiplier=This number multiplies the research productivity bonus that AI cores provide.
